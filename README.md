# drug_sensitivity_RelNets
Drug sensitivity prediction with lots of gene/drug/cell line interaction information.

TODO:

* Compile list of sources to generate prior relation network
* Write scripts to compile sources and data (e.g. expression) into network
* Visualize network with e.g. DLR?
...
* Profit!
